# Directories

(1) __DPJ Compare__: Dave Jacobson scored ~ 15% of the genotypes of the project indepedently of David Dayan to evaluate concordance. All files and analysis for the scoring comparison are located here.  
(2) __Genemapper Panels__: Backups of panels used in Genemapper to score raw ABI 3730 output  
(3) __Genotype Data__: All genetic data, old, new, filtered unfiltered etc. Contains a detailed readme.  

# Files

(1) __Big mistake log__: Describes file naming error during lab work. Future users should not need this unless they are rescoring raw ABI output.  
(2) __genotype_data_prep__ R notebook containing all work to assemble final genotype files. Also contains a lot of work doing QC on samples and documenting discrepancies with prior datasets.
