The endnote format used in icluded here (Conservation Genetics (revised).ens) 

Files that use the _vector suffix have vector based graphics and word _vector files may open incorrectly on different platforms, only distribute the PDFs. All other word files should have pixel based images so the word docs will open correctly across platforms, but will have resolution problems and should not be used for distribution.

Figs 2 and 3 were created in powerpoint and the raw file is available in the "assignment_figure.pptx" file.

Draft IDs.docx is deprecated and should not be used by others (other than David Dayan)
