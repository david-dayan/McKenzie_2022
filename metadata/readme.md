Readme for Metadata Directory

Metadata for this project spans 15 years, two governmental agencies, subcontractors for field work, and two genetics labs with 5-6 different workers. This directory represents David Dayan's best attempt to organize and consolidate into a single file with all relevant information for the 2022 USACE report, future manuscripts and future reports. 

# Crucial Files

If you're here to pick up this project in the future there are a couple files you should prioritize:  
(1) metadata.RData / metadata.xslx : This is the final metadata file used for the 2022 analysis. The xlsx file has a useful readme. File is in the dayan_metadata/processed_metadata subdirectory  
(2) 10APR2016_Cougar_adult_master : This is the final dataset used for the 2016 manuscript.  

# Subdirectories

Some subdirectories have their own readmes, but the general outline below might still be useful

dayan_metadata: Dayans working directory for metadata consolidation  
      - intake_forms: documents with supplemental information to spreadsheets  
      - processed_metadata: directory for Dayan's secondary/complied metadata  
      - raw_metadata: primary, unprocessed metadata from field, or very close approximation to it  
prev_metadata: secondary, compiled metadata and progeny database queries from Sandra Bohn, Vickie Zeller, and final datasets used in 2016 manuscript  
maps: directory for maps from previous reports
